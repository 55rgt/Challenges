Background
Pentatonix began with Kirstin "Kirstie" Maldonado (born May 16, 1992), Mitchell "Mitch" Grassi (born July 24, 1992), and Scott Hoying (born September 17, 1991) who grew up together and were schoolmates at Martin High School in Arlington, Texas.[16] For a local radio show competition to meet the cast of Glee, they arranged and submitted a trio version of "Telephone". Despite losing the competition, their singing sparked attention at their school, and they began performing. Their version of "Telephone" by Lady Gaga featuring Beyoncé subsequently gained attention on YouTube.[17]


Avi Kaplan's basso profondo vocal range has been a prominent element of Pentatonix's sound.
Hoying and Maldonado both graduated from Martin High School in 2010, Grassi in 2011. Hoying went off to the University of Southern California (USC) to pursue a bachelor's degree in Popular Music, while Maldonado pursued a Musical Theater major at the University of Oklahoma.[18] While at USC, Scott Hoying joined an a cappella group called SoCal VoCals. He found out about The Sing-Off from another member of the group, Ben Bram (also their arranger, producer, and sound engineer), and was encouraged to audition for the show.[18] He persuaded Maldonado and Grassi to join him, but Bram suggested having a bass and beatboxer as well to support the group[19][20] Through a mutual friend, Hoying met Avriel "Avi" Kaplan (born April 17, 1989), a highly recognized vocal bass in the a cappella community. Then, the trio found Kevin Olusola (born October 5, 1988) on YouTube, where one of his videos in which he was simultaneously beatboxing and playing the cello (called "celloboxing") had gone viral. Olusola was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, and graduated pre-med from Yale University.[21][22]

The group met the day before the auditions for the third season of The Sing-Off began.[18][23] The group successfully auditioned for the show and eventually went on to win the title for 2011 (season three).[24]

Pentatonix, as suggested by Scott Hoying, is named after the pentatonic scale, a musical scale or mode with five notes per octave, representing the five members of the group.[25] They replaced the last letter with an "x" to make it more appealing.[26] The quintet derives its influences from pop, dubstep, electro, reggae, hip hop, and classical music.[16]
