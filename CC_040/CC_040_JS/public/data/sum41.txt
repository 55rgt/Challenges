1996–1998: Formative years

Founding member and drummer Steve Jocz, who was in the band from 1996 to 2013.
Sum 41 was formed by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley and drummer Steve Jocz, under the name Kaspir after Whibley convinced Jocz to join his band. Jocz was a drummer in another band and Whibley was convinced that "he was the best drummer around". After having several lead guitarists and lead vocalists try out for the band, the duo then added Dave Baksh as lead guitarist in order for Whibley to take over as lead vocalist. The group went through several bassists before picking Jason McCaslin to complete its line-up.[5] The group members decided to change the band's name for a Supernova show on September 28, 1996, which happened to be the 41st day of their summer vacation.[6]

1998–2000: Half Hour of Power
In 1998, the band recorded a demo tape on compact cassette which they sent to record companies in the hope of getting a recording contract. The tapes are considered rarities.[7]

From 1999 to 2000, the band recorded several new songs. The Introduction to Destruction and later the Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's DVDs both contain the self-recorded footage, which show the band performing a dance to "Makes No Difference" in front of a theatre.

Sum 41's first EP, Half Hour of Power, was released on June 27, 2000. The first single released by the band was "Makes No Difference", which had two different music videos.[8] The first video was put together using the video clips sent to the record label, and the second showed the band performing at a house party.[9] The album was certified gold in Canada. Following the success of the EP, the band began working on its first full-length album.

Sum 41's first full-length album, All Killer No Filler, was released on May 8, 2001.[10] The album was very successful; it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 2001.[10] "Fat Lip", the album's first single, achieved significant chart and commercial success; it topped the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart as well as many other charts around the world.[11] The song remains the band's most successful to date. After "Fat Lip", two more singles were released from the album: "In Too Deep" and "Motivation".[12] "In Too Deep" peaked at number 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, while "Motivation" peaked at number 24 on the same chart.[13][14] The album peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200 chart and at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums chart.[15] The album was a commercial success, and was certified Platinum in the United States, Canada and in the UK.[16] The album's name was taken from the initial reaction from Joe Mcgrath, an engineer working in the studio.[17]

The success of the album brought the band touring offers with mainstream bands such as Blink-182 and The Offspring.[18] The band spent much of 2001 touring; the group played over 300 concerts that year before returning to the studio to record another album.[19]

On November 26, 2002, the group released its second album, Does This Look Infected?[20] The special edition came with a DVD, Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's. Whibley said of the album: "We don't want to make another record that sounds like the last record, I hate when bands repeat albums."[21] The album featured a harder and edgier sound, and the lyrics featured a more serious outlook.[22] The album peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart and at number eight on the Top Canadian Albums chart.[23][24] It was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States, but was not as successful as its predecessor.[25][26]

The first single released from the album was "Still Waiting", which peaked at number seven on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.[13] The second single, "The Hell Song" peaked at number 13 on the chart.[13] "The Hell Song"'s music video depicted the band members using dolls with their pictures on them and others, such as Ozzy Osbourne and Pamela Anderson. The third single, "Over My Head (Better Off Dead)", had a video released exclusively in Canada and on the band's website, featuring live shots of the band. The video also appeared on the group's live DVD, Sake Bombs And Happy Endings (2003), as a bonus feature.[27] The band again began a long tour to promote the album before recording the group's third studio album.

2004–2005: Chuck
In late May 2004, the band travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo with War Child Canada, a branch of the British charity organization War Child, to document the country's civil war.[28] Days after arriving, fighting broke out in Bukavu near the hotel where the band was staying.[29]

The band waited for the fighting to die down, but it did not. During that time, a UN peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier, called for armoured carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly twenty hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and forty other civilians were taken to safety.

In honour of Pelletier, Sum 41 named its next album Chuck; it was released on October 12, 2004. The album is the band's heaviest and most serious album to date, and charted at number 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and on the Top Internet Albums chart. It also peaked at number two on the Canadian Albums chart and was the band's highest-charting album until it was surpassed by Underclass Hero. The album received positive reviews, and was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.[30][31]

The first single from the album was "We're All To Blame", which peaked at number 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was followed by "Pieces", a relatively soft song which reached the top of the charts in Canada. The next single was "Some Say", released only in Canada and Japan. The last single from the record was "No Reason", released at the same time as "Some Say", but with no music video. It was released only in Europe and the USA, where it reached number 16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart.[32]

A documentary of the band's experience in Congo was made into a film called Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo and later aired on MTV. War Child released it on DVD on November 29, 2005, in the United States and Canada.[33][34]

Following the album's release, the band went on a tour with Good Charlotte until 2006.[35] On December 21, 2005, Sum 41 released a live album, Happy Live Surprise, in Japan. The CD contained a full concert recorded live in London, Ontario and was produced by Whibley. The same CD was released March 7, 2006, in Canada under the name Go Chuck Yourself.

2006–2009: Underclass Hero, All the Good Shit and Baksh's departure

On May 10, 2006, Dave Baksh announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, Brown Brigade, which has a more "classic metal" sound. Baksh cited "creative differences" as the reason for his departure, but claimed that he was still on good terms with the band.[36] The next day, Whibley confirmed Baksh's departure and announced that the band would only replace him with a touring guitarist, who would not have any decision-making power in the band or be in videos, photo shoots, or albums. The band replaced Baksh with Gob frontman and guitarist Tom Thacker.[37]

Recording of the band's fourth studio album, Underclass Hero, began on November 8, 2006, and finished on March 14, 2007. On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on iTunes, "March of the Dogs". Although not a single, the band released it early because, according to Whibley, "the record [wouldn't] be out until the summer". Whibley was threatened with deportation for the song, because he metaphorically "killed the president" on it.[38]

The album, backed by the first single and title track, "Underclass Hero", was released on July 24, 2007. Despite mixed reviews, the album was a commercial success, debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the Billboard Rock Albums chart, the band's highest US chart position to date. It also peaked at number one on the Canadian Albums chart and on the Alternative Albums chart, a first for the band on both the charts.[39] Two more singles were released from the album, "Walking Disaster" and "With Me". "With Me" especially found radio success by 2008. Underclass Hero was certified Platinum in Canada.

In October 2007, the band began the Strength in Numbers Tour, a tour of Canada with Canadian band Finger Eleven; Die Mannequin opened each of Sum 41's shows. During the tour, Whibley sustained a herniated disk. As a result, the group cancelled the rest of its shows.[40] After Whibley recovered from his injury, the band continued the Underclass Hero tour in March 2008 and toured until early July, when the group began preparation for its next album.[41]

On August 7, 2008, McCaslin announced in a journal entry on the band's site that it was taking time off from touring to do other things. Afterward, the group began working on the band's next studio album. McCaslin worked on the second album by his side-project, The Operation M.D. Jocz toured as a drummer for The Vandals, and Whibley toured with his then-wife, Avril Lavigne.[citation needed]

On November 26, 2008, Sum 41 released a greatest hits album in Japan titled 8 Years of Blood, Sake and Tears. The album included a previously unreleased song, "Always", and a DVD, which contains each of the band's music videos.[42] On March 17, the band released the worldwide version of the album titled All the Good Shit.[43]

Drummer Steve Jocz confirmed that Tom Thacker was now an official member of Sum 41, and would take part in the writing and recording.[44] On November 5, 2009, Whibley posted a blog on the band's MySpace page announcing Gil Norton as the producer of the band's upcoming album, also saying that 20 songs were already written for the album.[45] In an interview with Tom Thacker, some working titles for songs for the new album were confirmed, including "Panic Attack", "Jessica Kill" and "Like Everyone Else".[46] Pre-production for the new album took 13 days in December 2009, with the band officially entering the studio to begin recording at Perfect Sound Studios on January 26, 2010. The new studio album, titled Screaming Bloody Murder,[47] was expected for a late 2010 release, but was delayed until early 2011.[48] The band finished recording on June 24, 2010, just before joining the 2010 Warped Tour. While the group was on the tour, the new album entered the post-production stages of mixing and mastering.[48] A new song called "Skumfuk" was leaked online on July 6, 2010.[49] In an interview with Canoe.ca, Steve Jocz said that while producer Gil Norton was originally hired to engineer the new album, he was only around for a week and Sum 41 self-produced the record.[48]


Guitarist Dave Baksh
The first single from the album, "Screaming Bloody Murder", was released on February 7, 2011, in the United States.[50][51] The song had its worldwide premiere on January 14, 2011, on Windsor, Ontario radio station 89X.[52] The album Screaming Bloody Murder was released in Japan on April 6, 2011.[53] On February 28, 2011, a stream of "Blood in My Eyes", another new song from the album, was released for free listening on Alternative Press.[54] On May 28, 2011, Sum 41 performed a live set for Guitar Center Sessions on DirecTV.

"Baby You Don't Wanna Know" was released as the album's second single.[56] The band shot a music video for the song during a day off in Germany.[57] A music video was also produced for the first single, "Screaming Bloody Murder", but it was left unreleased due to its content and difficulties with the label.[58]

In May 2011, during the band's tenth anniversary Japanese tour, they debuted some new songs from Screaming Bloody Murder, including "Reason to Believe", "Blood in My Eyes", "Sick of Everyone" and "Back Where I Belong". During the same tour, Whibley's cousin, Matt, who served as the band's assistant, as well as video photographer, joined the band on stage as an unofficial member to play the keyboards. He continued to play keyboards during the band's European summer tour in June–July 2011.

On August 9, 2011, Sum 41 released the live album Live at the House of Blues, Cleveland 9.15.07 – a live recording of a show that took place on September 15, 2007, in Cleveland, Ohio, while the band was touring its previous album Underclass Hero.[59]

On August 13, 2011, while the band was touring the US as part of the Vans Warped Tour, making up for dates the group had to cancel on its 2010 tour, the band was forced once again to cancel all remaining dates in the US and Canada after playing only three shows, when Whibley re-injured his back.[60] On August 23, 2011, it was announced on the band's official website the band would be postponing indefinitely all upcoming tour dates for 2011, while Whibley underwent treatment for his medical condition. It was confirmed that the band's first-ever South American tour, as well as the group's first-ever Asian tour (excluding Japan), would all be cancelled, and rescheduled for some time in 2012.[citation needed] In an interview with Jason McCaslin that took place in Oppikoppi, he said that "it's safe to say Sum 41 won't have another album out for at least the next two years".[61] In 2011 Sum 41 was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for the song "Blood in My Eyes", but lost to the Foo Fighters.[4]

In February 2012 the band shot a music video for the song "Blood in My Eyes", the third single from the album, with director Michael Maxxis in Los Angeles.[62] Shooting took place on February 29 at the desert around the Los Angeles area;[63] it was released a month later.

From November to December 2012 the band undertook the Does This Look Infected? 10th Anniversary Tour, touring the United States to celebrate the album's release in 2002.[64]
